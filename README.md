# ReFire: Smarter Cooking with What You Have

**ReFire** is a web application that helps make cooking easier and more efficient by suggesting recipes based on the ingredients you already have at home. Whether you're low on supplies or just want to avoid another grocery run, ReFire helps you make the most of what’s in your kitchen.

## Project Overview

ReFire was created to solve a simple but common problem: *"What can I cook with what I already have?"*  
By inputting the ingredients you have on hand, ReFire searches and suggests possible recipes, helping you save time, reduce waste, and discover new meals.
